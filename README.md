#  [HALF ADDER USING GDI IMPLEMENTATION](https://github.com/RX-N/GdiHalfAdder)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This page consists the design and implementation of GDI based Half Adder.




### [A Quick Glance at Half Adder](https://github.com/RX-N/GdiHalfAdder/blob/main/DOCUMENTS/Riaan%20Jain%20Stage%201%20Submission.pdf)
***
A **Half Adder** is a basic digital circuit that performs the addition of two binary digits. It generates two outputs: the sum and the carry. 

The Gate Diffusion Input (GDI) technique is a low-power design approach for digital circuits that allows efficient logic gate implementation with fewer transistors than conventional CMOS logic. The GDI technique utilizes a combination of NMOS and PMOS transistors to achieve the required logic functions with fewer components.

## Tools used for Simulation eSim/Ngspice/
***

eSim is a free/libre and open-source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis, and PCB design. It is an integrated tool built using free/libre and open-source software such as KiCad, Ngspice, GHDL, OpenModelica, Verilator, Makerchip, and SkyWater SKY130 PDK. eSim is released under GNU General Public License.


## Future Scope

***

* Comparing it to other methods of implementation like CMOS, Transmission Gate Logic and Pass-Transistor Logic.
